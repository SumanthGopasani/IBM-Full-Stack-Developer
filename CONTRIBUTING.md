Contributing Guidelines
Introduction
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance our IBM Full Stack Developer project. These guidelines are designed to help streamline the contribution process and ensure a high-quality and collaborative development environment.

How to Contribute
Fork the Repository: Begin by forking the repository to create your own copy. This allows you to make changes independently without affecting the main repository.

Create a Branch: Create a new branch for each significant change or feature you plan to add. Use descriptive names for your branches (e.g., feature/add-authentication or bugfix/fix-ui-issue).

Make Changes: Implement your changes in the new branch. Adhere to the coding standards and practices used in the project, which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend technologies used in the project.

Update Tests: If your changes affect functionality, ensure that you add or update relevant tests. This may involve updating unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

Update Documentation: Reflect any changes in the project documentation. Update README files, setup guides, API documentation, or any other relevant documents to ensure they accurately describe the current state of the project.

Commit Changes: Make clear and concise commits that describe the purpose of the changes. Use the present tense and include references to relevant issues or pull requests in your commit messages.

Push Changes: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

Submit a Pull Request: Open a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes, including what was added or fixed, and why it is important.

Review Process: Engage with feedback on your pull request. Be prepared to make revisions based on comments from maintainers or other contributors.

Merge: After your pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main branch. Ensure that the merge does not introduce any issues or conflicts.

Coding Standards
Front-End: Follow established conventions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use responsive design practices and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
Back-End: Adhere to the coding standards for server-side technologies used in the project. This includes practices for handling APIs, databases, and server logic.
Code Quality: Write clean, maintainable code. Use consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, and avoid code duplication.
Testing: Write and maintain tests that cover new features or bug fixes. Ensure that all tests pass and that they are included in the test suite.
Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on the projectâ€™s issue tracker. Provide a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
